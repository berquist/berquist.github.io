      <description>I was recently asked to create a short &amp;ldquo;quick reference&amp;rdquo; for cclib that could be handed out at the 2018 Avogadro User Group Meeting. Rather than directly reuse a poster from the MolSSI workshop on Python for Quantum Chemistry, I decided to try making a reference sheet in the style of Emacs or Modern Fortran. The goal is to show the basic entry points and some code structure, including parts that many users might not know about, namely the methods.</description>

      <description>If you run Arch Linux and the ORCA quantum chemistry package, and you&amp;rsquo;re getting segmentation faults before any output is produced, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason,
From this thread (password protected), older versions of ORCA compiled with static libraries no longer work on the latest versions of Arch Linux:
 It turns out that linux kernel 4.11 disabled vsyscall by default for security reasons. Applications compiled with older versions of glibc will break.</description>

      <description>My research interests primarily focus on electronic structure theory, and include:
 Pedagogical implementations of important algorithms, particularly in the context of Psi4NumPy. Using safe and strongly-typed yet highly-performant programming languages for algorithm implementations, such as Rust and Nim. Applying automatic differentiation to molecular property calculations.  My primary open-source contributions are to cclib, a Python library for parsing computational quantum chemistry logfiles into a program-agnostic representation, making it easy to perform complex analyses.</description>
